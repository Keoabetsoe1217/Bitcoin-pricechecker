        # Each time this method executes, we want to print the items in levelsList together with previousPrice

        # levels? 
        # We could try to use an elaborate set of IF-statements (I dare you to try this), but a much easier 
        # way is to simply add previousPrice and currentPrice to the list and then sort the list.
        #
        # However, we cannot simply use levelsList for this purpose, because it only stores values, while we
        # also want to print labeling text with these values - such as 'Price Level', 'Current Price' and
        # 'Previous Price'.
        # Therefore, we need to create a temporary list - called displayList - used for displaying purposes only. 
        # This new list must consist of sub-lists. Each sub-List will contain two items. 
        # The first item will be the display-data we want to print - consisting of the labeling text and the price. 
        # The second item consists of the price only. 
        # We will use the second item to sort the list - since it makes no sense to sort the list based on 
        # the label (the first item). 
        #
        # Example of displayList (containing sub-lists) after it was sorted:
        #

        #           ['Price Level:    9700.00',    9700.00],

        #           ['Previous Price: 9688.69',    9688.69],
